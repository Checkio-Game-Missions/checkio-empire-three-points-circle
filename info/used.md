**How it is used:**

This equation, also known as Equation of the Circle,
comes from the Pythagorean theorem when applied to any point on a circle:
the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length x − a and y − b.
Of course you can use this concept for you mathematics software, but we really just want to remind you about how awesome circles can be.
