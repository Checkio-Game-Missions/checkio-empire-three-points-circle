Through any three points that do not exist on the same line, there lies a unique circle.
The points of this circle are represented in a string with the coordinates like so:

`(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)`

Where _x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3_ are digits.

You should find the circle for the three given points, 
such that the circle lies through these point and return the result as a string with the equation of the circle.
In a Cartesian coordinate system (with an X and Y axis),
the circle with central coordinates of (x0,y0) and radius of r can be described with the following equation:

`(x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2=r^2`

Where _x0_, _y0_, _r_ are decimal numbers rounded to **two decimal points**.
Remove extraneous zeros and all decimal points, they are not necessary.
For rounding, use the standard mathematical rules.
